## 📋 What Console Logs to Expect

When you create a manual deposit, you'll see this sequence:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🚀 NEW MANUAL DEPOSIT REQUEST RECEIVED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📥 Request body: {
  "mt5AccountId": "12345678",
  "amount": 100,
  "transactionHash": "YOUR_HASH",
  ...
}

📋 Extracted data:
   - User ID: user-uuid
   - MT5 Account ID: 12345678
   - Amount: 100
   - Transaction Hash: YOUR_HASH
   - Proof File URL: file-url

🔍 Looking up MT5 account: { mt5AccountId: '12345678', userId: 'user-uuid' }
✅ MT5 account verified: internal-account-id

🔄 Creating deposit record for user: user-uuid
📊 Deposit data: { ... }

🔄 Creating MT5Transaction record...
📊 MT5Transaction data: {
  type: 'Deposit',
  amount: 100,
  currency: 'USD',
  status: 'pending',
  paymentMethod: 'manual',
  transactionId: 'YOUR_HASH',
  depositId: 'deposit-uuid',
  userId: 'user-uuid',
  mt5AccountId: 'internal-account-id'
}

✅✅✅ MT5Transaction CREATED SUCCESSFULLY! ✅✅✅
📋 MT5Transaction ID: mt5-transaction-uuid
📋 MT5Transaction full record: {
  "id": "mt5-transaction-uuid",
  "type": "Deposit",
  "amount": 100,
  "currency": "USD",
  "status": "pending",
  "depositId": "deposit-uuid",
  "userId": "user-uuid",
  ...
}

✅ Deposit request created successfully: deposit-uuid

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
✅ MANUAL DEPOSIT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📊 Summary:
   ✅ Deposit record created: ID = deposit-uuid
   ✅ Transaction record created
   ✅ MT5Transaction record created (check logs above)

🔍 To verify in database, run:
   SELECT * FROM "MT5Transaction" WHERE "depositId" = 'deposit-uuid';
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## ❌ If MT5Transaction Creation Fails

You'll see:

```
❌❌❌ FAILED TO CREATE MT5Transaction! ❌❌❌
❌ Error: [error message]
❌ Error code: [error code]
❌ Full error: [full error details]
```

**This tells you EXACTLY what's wrong!**

Common errors:
- "Unknown arg `depositId`" → Prisma client not regenerated (restart server)
- "Column 'depositId' does not exist" → Migration not applied
- "Foreign key constraint" → MT5Account doesn't exist

## 🧪 Test Steps

### 1. Start Backend Server
Run: **START_BACKEND_WITH_LOGS.bat** or `npm start`

### 2. Create a Manual Deposit
From your frontend, go to deposits and create a new manual deposit with:
- MT5 Account ID
- Amount (e.g., 100)
- Transaction Hash (any text like "TEST123")
- Proof file (optional)

### 3. Watch Console
Look for the detailed logs showing:
- ✅ Request received
- ✅ Data extracted
- ✅ MT5Transaction created successfully

### 4. Verify in Database

Run the verification script:
```bash
node verify-mt5-transaction.js
```

This will show:
- All MT5Transaction records
- Statistics (pending, completed, etc.)
- Any deposits missing MT5Transaction records

### 5. Manual Database Check

```sql
-- Get all MT5Transactions
SELECT * FROM "MT5Transaction" 
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC 
LIMIT 5;

-- Get MT5Transactions with deposit info
SELECT 
  mt5t.id,
  mt5t.amount,
  mt5t.status,
  mt5t."transactionId",
  mt5t."depositId",
  mt5t."userId",
  d.method AS deposit_method
FROM "MT5Transaction" mt5t
LEFT JOIN "Deposit" d ON d.id = mt5t."depositId"
ORDER BY mt5t."createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## 📊 Console Log Sections

| Section | What It Shows |
|---------|---------------|
| 🚀 REQUEST RECEIVED | Incoming request data |
| 📋 Extracted data | Parsed fields (amount, hash, file) |
| 🔍 Looking up MT5 account | Account verification |
| 🔄 Creating deposit record | Deposit creation |
| 🔄 Creating MT5Transaction | MT5Transaction creation attempt |
| ✅✅✅ CREATED SUCCESSFULLY | Success confirmation + full record |
| ❌❌❌ FAILED TO CREATE | Error details if failed |
| ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY | Final summary |

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### No Console Logs Appear
- Backend server not running
- Check you're watching the correct terminal
- Verify endpoint is `/api/manual-deposit/create`

### Only Deposit Created, No MT5Transaction
- Look for "❌❌❌ FAILED TO CREATE MT5Transaction!" in logs
- Error message will tell you what's wrong
- Most likely: Prisma client not regenerated → Restart server

### "Unknown arg" Errors
- Prisma client outdated
- Stop server → `npx prisma generate` → Restart

### Foreign Key Constraint Errors
- MT5Account doesn't exist for that user
- Check `mt5AccountId` is correct
- Verify MT5Account exists in database

## ✅ Success Checklist

After creating a deposit, verify:

- [ ] Console shows "🚀 NEW MANUAL DEPOSIT REQUEST RECEIVED"
- [ ] Console shows extracted data (amount, hash, file)
- [ ] Console shows "✅✅✅ MT5Transaction CREATED SUCCESSFULLY!"
- [ ] Console shows full MT5Transaction record with all fields
- [ ] Console shows final "✅ MANUAL DEPOSIT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!"
- [ ] Database query shows new MT5Transaction record
- [ ] MT5Transaction has: depositId, userId, currency, transactionId filled

## 🎯 Expected Database Records

After creating one manual deposit, you should have:

1. **Deposit table:** 1 new record (status: pending)
2. **Transaction table:** 1 new record (status: pending)
3. **MT5Transaction table:** 1 new record (status: pending) ← **KEY!**

All 3 should be linked via IDs.
