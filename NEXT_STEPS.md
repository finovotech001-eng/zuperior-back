# Next Steps - Manual Deposit MT5Transaction Tracking

## ✅ What's Been Completed

1. **Database Schema Updated**
   - MT5Transaction table enhanced with tracking columns
   - Deposit, Transaction, Withdrawal models updated
   - All migrations successfully applied

2. **Controllers Updated**
   - `manualDeposit.controller.js` - Creates MT5Transaction on deposit request
   - Admin approve/reject automatically updates MT5Transaction status
   - Complete tracking with timestamps and admin info

3. **Routes Fixed**
   - `manualDeposit.routes.js` - Properly configured for manual deposits
   - Endpoints: `/api/manual-deposit/create`, `/api/manual-deposit/user`, etc.

## 🚀 Required Actions (Do This Now)

### 1. Stop Backend Server
If your backend server is running, **stop it now**.

### 2. Regenerate Prisma Client
```bash
cd zuperior-back
npx prisma generate
```

This will update the Prisma client with all the new MT5Transaction columns.

### 3. Restart Backend Server
```bash
npm start
# or
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Testing Manual Deposit

### Step 1: Create a Manual Deposit
Use your frontend or API client to create a manual deposit:

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/manual-deposit/create`

**Body:**
```json
{
  "mt5AccountId": "YOUR_MT5_ACCOUNT_ID",
  "amount": 100,
  "transactionHash": "TEST123"
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Deposit record created (status: pending)
- ✅ Transaction record created (status: pending)
- ✅ MT5Transaction record created (status: pending) ← **VERIFY THIS!**

### Step 2: Check Database
Query the MT5Transaction table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "MT5Transaction" 
WHERE type = 'Deposit' 
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

**You should see:**
- New record with status = 'pending'
- userId populated
- depositId populated
- paymentMethod = 'manual'
- All tracking columns present

### Step 3: Approve the Deposit
Use admin account to approve:

**Endpoint:** `PUT /api/manual-deposit/:depositId/status`

**Body:**
```json
{
  "status": "approved"
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ MT5 API called to add funds
- ✅ MT5Transaction updated to status = 'completed'
- ✅ processedBy = admin user ID
- ✅ processedAt = current timestamp

### Step 4: Verify in Database
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  amount,
  status,
  "processedBy",
  "processedAt",
  "depositId"
FROM "MT5Transaction"
WHERE type = 'Deposit'
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Should show:**
- status = 'completed'
- processedBy = admin ID
- processedAt = timestamp

## 📊 Quick Database Checks

### Check all deposit transactions
```sql
SELECT 
  mt5t.id,
  mt5t.type,
  mt5t.amount,
  mt5t.status,
  mt5t."paymentMethod",
  d.method AS deposit_method,
  mt5t."createdAt",
  mt5t."processedAt"
FROM "MT5Transaction" mt5t
LEFT JOIN "Deposit" d ON d.id = mt5t."depositId"
WHERE mt5t.type = 'Deposit'
ORDER BY mt5t."createdAt" DESC;
```

### Check pending deposits
```sql
SELECT * FROM "MT5Transaction" 
WHERE status = 'pending' AND type = 'Deposit';
```

### Check who processed deposits
```sql
SELECT 
  mt5t.*,
  u.email AS admin_email
FROM "MT5Transaction" mt5t
LEFT JOIN "User" u ON u.id = mt5t."processedBy"
WHERE mt5t."processedBy" IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY mt5t."processedAt" DESC;
```

## 📝 Console Logs to Watch

When creating deposit, look for:
```
🔍 Looking up MT5 account: { mt5AccountId: '...', userId: '...' }
✅ MT5 account verified: ...
🔄 Creating deposit record for user: ...
✅ Deposit request created successfully: ...
```

When approving, look for:
```
✅ Deposit approved and MT5 balance updated
✅ Deposit status updated to: approved
```

## 🎯 What to Verify

1. **On Deposit Creation:**
   - [ ] Deposit record created
   - [ ] Transaction record created
   - [ ] **MT5Transaction record created** ← Key!
   - [ ] All records have status = 'pending'
   - [ ] MT5Transaction has userId and depositId

2. **On Deposit Approval:**
   - [ ] MT5 API called successfully
   - [ ] MT5Transaction status = 'completed'
   - [ ] MT5Transaction has processedBy (admin ID)
   - [ ] MT5Transaction has processedAt (timestamp)
   - [ ] Deposit status = 'approved'

3. **On Deposit Rejection:**
   - [ ] MT5Transaction status = 'rejected'
   - [ ] MT5Transaction comment has rejection reason
   - [ ] MT5Transaction has processedBy and processedAt

## 📄 Documentation

See detailed guides:
- **MANUAL_DEPOSIT_GUIDE.md** - Complete manual deposit flow and API docs
- **DEPOSIT_TRANSACTION_TRACKING_SUMMARY.md** - Overall implementation details

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Focus:** Manual deposits only (crypto ignored as requested)
- **KYC:** Ignored for now (as requested)
- **MT5Transaction:** Automatically created for every deposit request
- **No changes needed** to frontend - just use existing deposit endpoints

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Prisma Client Generation Fails
- Make sure backend server is stopped
- Delete `node_modules/.prisma` folder
- Run `npx prisma generate` again

### MT5Transaction Not Creating
- Check console logs for errors
- Verify database migration applied: `npx prisma migrate status`
- Check Prisma client regenerated with new columns

### Can't Find Manual Deposit Route
- Verify server logs show: "✅ Routes loaded successfully"
- Check `/api/manual-deposit/create` endpoint exists
- Verify authentication token is valid

## 🎉 Success Criteria

✅ Create manual deposit → See 3 records in DB (Deposit, Transaction, MT5Transaction)
✅ Approve deposit → MT5Transaction status changes to 'completed'
✅ MT5Transaction has all tracking info (userId, processedBy, timestamps)
✅ Console logs show successful creation and updates
✅ Admin can view complete audit trail of all deposits

**Ready to test!** Stop server → Generate Prisma client → Restart → Create deposit → Check DB! 🚀
